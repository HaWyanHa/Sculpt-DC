					<h4>When should I get there?</h4>
					<p>We recommend coming at least 15 minutes early for your first class, so that we have enough time to get you signed up, give you a tour and answer any questions you may have. Other than that, if you are here 5 minutes before your class starts, you are good to go. If you are not here 5 minutes prior to class starting, we reserve the right to give your spot to any drop-in or waitlisted students.</p>
					<h4>What should I wear?</h4>
					<p>Come ready to sweat and have fun! Cycle Classes: A moisture wicking top, fitted bottoms and stiff-soled shoes. Minimalist sneakers are strongly discouraged. All of our bikes are fitted with SPD style clips as well as conventional cages. Yoga/Barre/Sculpt 360 Classes: Clothing that you are comfortable sweating in. Women typically wear yoga pants or shorts with a workout top. Men wear running shorts or light pants and a fitted shirt  that won’t get in the way of practice.</p>
					<h4>Will I get into class if I show up late?</h4>
					<p>If you haven’t checked in at the front desk 5 minutes before the start of class, your spot may be released to a fellow client who is on the wait list and wanting to sweat! We will allow all members to enter class up to 5 minutes after the class start time.  Anymore than 5 minutes and we can not let you in, but are happy to rebook you in another class.</p>
					<h4>How will I know if I get in off the wait list?</h4>
					<p>You will get an email confirmation at least 2 hours prior to the start of class. If you are on the wait list and can’t make it to the studio, please remove yourself from the list. Once you are in the class, we have to charge you for your space.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-3 col-md-offset-1">
					<h4>What should I bring?</h4>
					<p>Cycle Classes:  We provide complimentary towels. If you have cycling shoes with SPD clips, bring them. If not, sneakers are great. Yoga/Barre/Sculpt 360 Classes: Mat rentals are $2 or free for monthly members.  If you’d like to rent a yoga towel, you can do so for $1 at the front desk.  Water. You can buy it for $2 at the studio or fill up water bottles at our water filtration system.</p>
					<h4>Where can I leave my things?</h4>
					<p>We have complimentary lockers for which you will receive a key when signing-in. In addition, we have cubbies for any larger items. A place to change or shower? Sculpt DC has 4 unisex bathrooms and 2 showers. In addition, we have changing areas. We provide all the toiletries you would need including: shampoo, conditioner, styling products, hair dryers and flat irons.  You can rent bath towels for $2 at the front desk.</p>
					<h4>What happens if I can’t make a class I have signed up for?</h4>
					<p>All reservations for cycle classes must be cancelled 3 hours prior to the class start time.  All reservations for a yoga class must be cancelled 1 hour prior to the class start time.  You can cancel a class online, through our FREE mobile app or by calling the studio. Unlimited Access Pass holders are allowed one late cancellation/no-show per month with no penalty before a $10 fee is assessed for all further late cancellations/no-shows in the same calendar month. All proceeds from the No-Show fees will be donated to our charity of the month. All members on a class package that cancel inside the window will lose a class from their class package. This fee does not apply to our introductory New Member Offer</p>
